# MS-DS_Project
This project is for visualizing the trajectory of the dataset on the map to help in the process of understanding the data and make some future prediction of what is missing to be introduced and extend the feautures or improve the existing features.

It takes the Longitude and Latitude of different users and the time and date on which these different Users were at that particular location and store them into a database that were created using sqlalchemy and communication to the web application using Flask.

All the trajectories are displayed on the map using leaflet.js and the web application is written in Java, python and Jinja2.
